1.  I grew up in Pleasant Hill, CA, then moved to Omaha, NE when

2.  I don't remember exactly, but it was probably either an Astronaut or
    Fireman.

3.  Did my undergrad at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.

4.  First I studied Chemistry, then switch to math.  I learned how to program
    on the side and for some data science work I did.

5.  I worked for my university, developing data dashboards for a research
    project into administrative costs.

6.
